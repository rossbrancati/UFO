Folder contains three functions and a master script that will consecutively run each function. 
 
UFO_compiler_and_plotter contains two variables titled "group" and "base_file_path" which should be edited depending on the structure of your file storage. 
This script will run three custom functions in the following order:

    1) UFO_participant_mean_waveforms.m: calcualtes the mean of each condition all trials included in that particular condition
    
    2) UFO_ensemble_means_and_stdevs.m: computes the mean and standard deviation of each variable for each group. Outputs four files (one for each condition) with
       the following structure: |mean V1|Stdev V1|mean V2|Stdev V2|mean V3|Stdev V3|...etc
       
    3) UFO_waveform_plotting.m: plots each participants sagittal plane joint angles, moments, and powers on its own plot. Outputs four total figures with a 3x4 subplot
 
 
Additionally, there is an R script (UFO_waveform_plotting.R) that contains ggplot scripts to plot the waveforms +/- stdevs. The plots are currently set up to plot the 
pre and post fatigue waveforms on one plot for each speed. I did this in R because these plots are better for publication purposes.
