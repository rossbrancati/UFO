function [ xp ] = cent_diff3( x, dt )
%CENT_DIFF3 Numerical approximation of the derivative of x via a
%three-point central difference which provides second order accuracy (i.e.,
%truncation errors on the order of dt^2). Derivatives of the first and last
%data points are estimated using front_diff and back_diff, respectively.
%
% ARGUMENTS
% x - Vector or matrix containing numerical data. If x is a matrix
% differentation operates along the vertical dimensions (i.e., each column
% is differentiated).
% 
% dt - Unit change in time between samples (assumed constant).
%
% RETURNS
% xp - First-order derivative of x with respect to time. If x is an m x n
% vector or matrix, xp will have a size of m x n.
